    I'm an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
    I'm interested in solving high-value problems with data-driven technology created at the intersection of machine learning development 
    and software engineering.

    Apart from university coursework, I'm currently involved in ML research, building cool products with my friends at campus clubs, and building cool 
    projects by myself when I'm bored. Read more about what I have done/am doing in my bio!

    Besides computer stuff and academic stuff, I also love playing table tennis, eating Chick-fil-A, and watching MMA or American Football (go Niners!).
