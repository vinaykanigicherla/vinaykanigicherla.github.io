    I'm an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
    My primary technical interests lie in distributed systems, machine learning, backend engineering, and databases.
    In my free time, I love playing badminton, eating Chick-fil-A, making Spotify playlists, and watching MMA, F1, and the NFL.
