# Experience 
**Undergraduate Researcher** @ CAHLR Lab -- *May 2021 to Present*
- Working in the CAHLR Lab under Prof. Zachary Pardos, currently investigating unsupervised embedding generation for college courses using FastText, developing methodologies for course relationship mining in course vector offset spaces, and creating novel deep learning approach for the college course prerequisite prediction task. 
<br>

**Project Manager** @ Big Data at Berkeley -- *May 2021 to Present*
- Project Manager in BDAB's Projects Committee.
- Responsibilities include leading a team of consultants, client acquisition, consultant recruitment, and workshop organization.
- BDAB's Projects Committee is dedicated to providing business leaders with advanced data analytics and machine learning models to guide critical decisions and accelerate growth.
<br>
 
**Machine Learning Fellow** @ Launchpad.AI -- *May 2021 to Aug. 2021*
- Worked as a fellow in the 19th Cohort of Launchpad.AI’s Fellowship.AI program on two projects over the course of 4 months:
- Masking Fetal Gender in Ultrasound Images:
  - Developed a cutting-edge real-time object detection system to mask fetal gender in ultrasound videos of pregnant women.
  - Optimized YOLOv5 for ultrasound object detection and implemented structural similarity-based technique to minimize false negatives during video inference.
  - Co-authored research paper detailing our effort; Pre-print soon to be released on arXiv.
- Fitness Chatbot Assistant:
  - Developed a MVP for a chatbot assistant for athletes that is specialized to answer fitness, diet, and sports related queries.
  - Leveraged RASA Framework to build and finetune chatbot and added integrations with serpAPI Google Search and BlenderBot to handle out-of-scope queries.
- Worked in a fast-paced result-oriented environment, engaging in weekly sprints and presenting to the CEO on a weekly basis.

**Machine Learning Intern** @ CAHLR Lab -- *Jan 2021 to May 2021* 
- Worked under Prof. Zachary Pardos in the CAHLR Lab as an ML Developer on developing the course prerequisite prediction functionality of the AskOski Research Project (https://askoski.berkeley.edu).
- Developed novel multi-input autoencoder based neural network architecture that combines a BERT encoder and Course2Vec vector encoder that is capable of predicting multiple prerequisites for a given course.
- Utilized 900,000+ row student enrollment history dataset and ~10,000 row course catalog description dataset in training.
- Iteratively improved solution over the course of the project, experimenting with ensembles of classical ML models, other neural network architectures, and other NLP vector representation techniques like Doc2Vec along the way.
<br>

**Data Consultant** @ TripAdvisor -- *Feb 2021 to May 2021*
- Developed NLP based solutions for TripAdvisor working through Big Data at Berkeley's Projects Committee.
- Implemented BERT based neural network for multi-class multi-label classification of customer service chat interactions that achieved an accuracy of 92%.
- Leveraged autoencoder based approach for anomaly detection in order to create an issue novelty flagging system. 
- Both classification and anomaly detection models deployed and actively used in production.
- Utilized unsupervised topic modelling techniques on raw chat corpus to extract and present valuable business insights regarding customer service workload optimization to Tripadvisor customer service team leadership.
- Conducted extensive data cleaning, text data preprocessing, feature generation, and text embedding generation.
<br>

**Computer Vision Intern** @ PointR Data Inc. -- *May 2019 to Aug 2019*
- Developed multiple-object tracking algorithm to track and assign unique IDs to customers in real-time from raw CCTV camera footage.
- Leveraged Tiny YOLOv3 Architecture for object detection task; conducted transfer learning in order to optimize human detection accuracy.
- Implemented object tracking methods based on bounding box velocity and frame-to-frame bounding box IOU.
